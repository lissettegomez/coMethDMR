}
\arguments{
\item{betaOne_df}{matrix of beta values for one genomic region,
with row names = CpG IDs, column names = sample IDs}

\item{pheno_df}{a data frame with phenotype and covariates, with variable
\code{Sample} indicating sample IDs.}

\item{contPheno_char}{character string of the main effect (a continuous
phenotype) to be tested for association with methylation values in the
region}

\item{covariates_char}{character vector for names of the covariate variables}

\item{modelType}{type of mixed model, can be \code{randCoef} for random
coefficient mixed model, or \code{simple} for simple linear mixed model.}

\item{genome}{Human genome of reference hg19 or hg38}

\item{arrayType}{Type of array, can be "450k" or "EPIC"}

\item{outLogFile}{Name of log file for messages of mixed model analysis}
}
\value{
A dataframe with one row for association result of one region: \code{Estimate}, \code{StdErr}, and
   \code{pvalue} for the association of methylation values in the genomic
   region tested vs. continuous phenotype \code{contPheno_char}
}
\description{
Fit mixed model to methylation values in one genomic region
}
\details{
This function implements a mixed model to test association between
   methylation values in a genomic region with a continuous phenotype.

   When \code{randCoef} is selected, the model is

   \code{methylation M value ~ contPheno_char + covariates_char + (1|Sample) + (contPheno_char|CpG)}.
   The last term specifies random intercept and slope for each CpG.

   When \code{simple} is selected, the model is

   \code{methylation M value ~ contPheno_char + covariates_char + (1|Sample)}

   In our simulation studies, we found both models are conservative, so p-values are estimated from
   normal distributions instead of t-distributions.
