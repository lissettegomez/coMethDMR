\usage{
lmmTestAllRegions(betas, region_ls, pheno_df, contPheno_char,
  covariates_char, modelType = c("randCoef", "simple"),

}
\arguments{
\item{betas}{data frame or matrix of beta values for all genomic regions,
with row names = CpG IDs, column names = sample IDs. This is often the
genome-wide array data.}

\item{region_ls}{a list of genomic regions, each item is a vector of CpG IDs
   within a genomic region. The co-methylated
regions can be obtained by function \code{CoMethAllRegions}.}

\item{pheno_df}{a data frame with phenotype and covariates, with variable
\code{Sample} indicating sample IDs.}

\item{contPheno_char}{character string of the main effect (a continuous
phenotype) to be tested for association with methylation values in each
region}

\item{covariates_char}{character vector for names of the covariate variables}

\item{modelType}{type of mixed model, can be \code{randCoef} for random
coefficient mixed model, or \code{simple} for simple linear mixed model.}

\item{genome}{Human genome of reference hg19 or hg38}

\item{arrayType}{Type of array, can be "450k" or "EPIC"}

\item{outFile}{output .csv file with the results for the mixed model analysis}

\item{outLogFile}{log file for mixed models analysis messages}

\item{nCores_int}{Number of computing cores to be used when executing code
in parallel. Defaults to 1 (serial computing).}

\item{...}{Dots for additional arguments passed to the cluster constructor.
See \code{\link{CreateParallelWorkers}} for more information.}
}
\value{
(1) output file: a .csv file with location of the genomic region
  (\code{chrom, start, end}), number of CpGs (\code{nCpGs}), \code{Estimate},
  Standard error (\code{StdErr}) of the test statistic, p-value and False
  Discovery Rate (FDR) for association between methylation values in each
  genomic region with phenotype (\code{pValue}).

(2) log file: a .txt file that includes messages for mixed model fitting

\description{
Fit mixed model to test association between a continuous phenotype and
methylation values in a list of genomic regions
}
\details{
This function implements a mixed model to test association between
   methylation values in a genomic region with a continuous phenotype.

   When \code{randCoef} is selected, the model is

   \code{methylation M value ~ contPheno_char + covariates_char + (1|Sample) + (contPheno_char|CpG)}.
   The last term specifies both random intercept and slope for each CpG.

   When \code{simple} is selected, the model is

   \code{methylation M value ~ contPheno_char + covariates_char + (1|Sample)}

   In our simulation studies, we found both models are conservative, so p-values are estimated from
   normal distributions instead of t-distributions.

   For the results of mixed models, note that

   (1) When mixed model failed to converge, p-value for mixed model is set to 1.

   (2) When mixed model is singular, at least one of the estimated variance
   components for intercepts or slopes random effects is 0, because there
   isn't enough variabilities in data to estimate the random effects. In this
   case, mixed model reduces to a fixed effects model. The p-values for these
   regions are still valid.
