Description: coMethDMR identifies genomic regions associated with continuous
  phenotypes by optimally leverages covariations among CpGs within predefined
  genomic regions. Instead of testing all CpGs within a genomic region,
  coMethDMR carries out an additional step that selects co-methylated
  sub-regions first without using any outcome information. Next, coMethDMR tests
  association between methylation within the sub-region and continuous phenotype
  using a random coefficient mixed effects model, which models both variations
  between CpG sites within the region and differential methylation simultaneously.
